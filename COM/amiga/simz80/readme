		      A CP/M emulator for the Amiga

Release one : 3 - October - 1988

(C) Copyright By Ulf Nordquist.

This software package emulates a CPM computer with a Z80 processor connected
to an ADM3A terminal.

This software may only be used for non-commercial purposes, but may be freely
distributed as long as all the files in the package is kept together.

The package consists of these files:

The source code:
cz.a (the main module)
ce.a,(the bios, bdos and terminal emulator)
zek.a, zekcb.a, zekdd.a, zeked.a (the Z80 emulator)

The link command file:
LinkCPM
This file:
Readme

			     How to use it
			     -------------

Before you start the emulator, assign a: to the directory where the cpm
files are.

[ Ed. Note: i.e. assuming undisturbed use of this disk:
   1> Assign a: AmigaLibdisk165:CPM/DriveA      
 -Fred ><> ]

The program has four menues:

Menu Project

   About
      This gives the expected result

   Version
      List the version number for the modules and the task address

   Quit
      This also gives the expected result

Menu Windows

   Z80 processor
      Opens a window which shows the Z80 registers. It also has three
      gadgets: Step - Stop/Run - Reset
	 Step:	Executes the next instruction, the Z80 must be stopped
		for this to work
	 Stop:	Stops the Z80 processor, the gadget then changes to a
		Run gadget
	 Reset: Exit to the A> prompt

Terminal

   Trap Esc Seq
      Gives a requester when the terminal emulator finds an undefined
      escape sequence sent to it, normally such escape sequences are
      ignored

   Log to File
      Asks for a file name. Opens this file and logs all activity in
      the console window to it

Debug

   Count
      Increments a counter for each Z80 instruction as it is emulated,
      and for each BDOS and BIOS call. Max count is 255.

   Save Count
      Asks for a file name. Writes the count result so far as a binary
      image to it. This file is organized as this:
      byte $00 - $ff - one byte opcodes
      byte $100-$1ff - $cb two byte opcodes
      byte $200-$2ff - $dd two byte opcodes
      byte $300-$3ff - $ed two byte opcodes
      byte $400-$4ff - $fd two byte opcodes
      byte $500-$57f - BDOS calls
      byte $580-$5ff - BIOS calls
      Note. This is a binary file. To be able to look at it by an editor,
      convert it to hex format by using opt h with type.
	 Example: type >file cpm.count opt h

   Trace
      Asks for a file name. Writes the address in hex for each instruction
      as it is emulated to it.

Apart from these menues, the program is used as any CP/M computer

		 Programs the emulator has been tested with
		 ------------------------------------------

		   --- First the programs that works ---

D - seems to work alright

M80, L80 - seems to work alright

   I have assembled and linked the program SPIRAL.MAC and ASMTEST.MAC

ZSID - seems to work alright

   I have used ZSID to try to find why MBasic, WordStar and TurboPascal
   did not work.

MBasic - seems to work alright

   I have run the program SUPTRK3.BAS

WordStar - I have some problems with this
   WordStar is unable to find the end of files, it just ignores if bdos20
   (read sequential) returns $ff as end of file flag

TurboPascal - here are also some problems
   Compile to disk does not work, it says that the disk is full (which it
   is not)

   However I have edited, compiled to memory and run the file TEST.PAS

		--- Now for the program that do not work ---

PIP - copy from CON: to a file works, but copy from file to file does not
   work either it gives a disk write or a disk read error

SUBMIT - nothing happens, just a little disk activity

XSUB - it just says: Xsub Already Present
