As was the case for its predecessor, this program is in the
**Public Domain**.  All I ask is that my name be left on the code
if it is used elsewhere.  (As if that's likely at this late date!)

The *Z-80* simulation routines were taken from an independent Amiga
port/enhancement of the original code done by *Charlie Gibbs* and
*Willi Kusche*.  Their code is slightly more restricted.  I have
placed their disclaimer at the front of `com.c`; their code is
conditionally included in the simulator.  If it isn't included,
you get a plain *8080* CPU with a few *Z-80* instructions (as
before, under **CP/M-68K**).
