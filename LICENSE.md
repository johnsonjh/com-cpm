As was the case for its predecessor, this program is in the
**Public Domain**. All I ask is that my name be left on the code
if it is used elsewhere. (As if that's likely at this late date!)

The _Z-80_ simulation routines were taken from an independent Amiga
port/enhancement of the original code done by _Charlie Gibbs_ and
_Willi Kusche_. Their code is slightly more restricted. I have
placed their disclaimer at the front of `com.c`; their code is
conditionally included in the simulator. If it isn't included,
you get a plain _8080_ CPU with a few _Z-80_ instructions (as
before, under **CP/M-68K**).
