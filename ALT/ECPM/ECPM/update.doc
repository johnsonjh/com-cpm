  This CP/M emulator is a major enhancement to the CP/M simulator written by
Charlie Gibbs.  The simulator is part of disk number 109 of the Fred Fish
library.

  In all the years I've been in the computer game, software that runs on a
given CPU and pretends it's some other CPU, has been referred to as an
emulator.  Therefore, while the original author of this software referred to
it as a simulator, I'm calling it an emulator.

  The main reason I started to modify the emulator was to see if I could run
the CP/M version of Turbo Pascal.  Many months later, this new version CAN
run Turbo Pascal.  This feat(?) was accomplished by adding emulation logic
for about 280 Z80 op codes.

  How did I decide which ones to add, you might ask.  Why, by running Turbo
Pascal under the emulator and adding logic for whatever op code the emulator
said it couldn't handle.  Hell, if I'd known the Turbo Pascal used so many
Z80 op codes, I'd never have started the project.

  Yes, that means if you use the emulator to run a Z80 program, other than
Turbo Pascal, you may discover a Z80 instruction that I didn't write code
for.  I just took at the Mostek Z80 Technical Manual that I used as a
reference text for this project; it looks as if there are about 60 or so
op codes that I didn't write code for.

  I also added code to handle a bunch of BDOS calls that Turbo Pascal needs.

  Other things I didn't do:
     1.  Update the mnemonic op code table used by the tracing version
     2.  Correct the horrible mnemonics I inserted into the source code
         before I got my hands on proper Z80 op code mnemonics

  Finally, the names of people or companies whose work needs recognition:

     1.  Charlie Gibbs, for his original simulator and for his excellent
           68000 macro assembler

     2.  Robert Freed, for his CP/M program that dissolves MS/DOS format
           archives.  Not so much for the unARCing program, but for the
           really outstanding assembly language source file, for that
           program, that he made generally available

     3.  CC Software (the proprietor's name escapes me), whose fascinating
           source code generator allowed me to create a source file for my
           copy of Turbo Pascal with minimum hassle

     4.  Joan Riff, for her really excellent CP/M emulator for the MS/DOS
           world

  Without the source for Freed's unARCer and for Turbo Pascal, I would not
have been able to find some of the bugs that cropped in the emulation logic
that I added.

  Oh yeah, the works of the people mentioned above are available for
