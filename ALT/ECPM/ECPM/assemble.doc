  The command file named 'alecpm' is used to assemble and link the CP/M
emulator.  The command file named 'alecpmt' is used to assemble and link a
version of the emulator that is capable of tracing individual instructions.

  Both of these command files assume that you already have a copy of the
following three files:
    1. A68k      - macro assembler by Charlie Gibbs
    2. Blink     - linker by the Software Distillery
    3. Small.lib - pint sized version of amiga.lib

  All of the above files are available on Fred Fish disks.  The numbers are
as follows:

    Name         FF disk number
    ----         --------------
    A68k              110
    Blink              40
    Small.lib          92

  The above files are also available for downloading from the KMMM Pascal
BBS.  Your local Amiga BBS may also have them.

  The command file 'alecpm' expects a single digit parameter.  For example,
to create a new version of the emulator after altering part 1 of the
assembly language source file, you would enter the CLI command
'EXECUTE ALECPM 1'.  Enter 'EXECUTE ALECPM 2' after altering part 2 of the
source.  Before running either variant of the above commnads for the first
time, enter 'a68k ecpm1.asm' and 'a68k ecpm2.asm' to be sure that both
object files needed by the link step are present.

  The command file 'alecpm' also includes a step to delete the tracing
version of the emulator, since altering either part of the source file will
cause the tracing version to become outdated.

  Now for the commercial:
